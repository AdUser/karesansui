Installation
------------
For CentOS/Red Hat, the easiest way to make
Karesansui work is to download the RPM based
installer and follow the steps.

Installation from Source Code
------------------------------
First, you have to have the packages below installed and working.

 * libvirt
 * libvirt python bindings
 * lighttpd
 * openssl098
 * Mako
 * SQLAlchemy
 * python-flup
 * python-pysqlite
 * python-simplejson
 * python-webpy
 * pysilhouette
 * tightvnc-java

(You can install these packages manually and edit Karesansui configurations to get them work, but it's a relatively hard work. We have RPM packages in the RPM installer for convenience)

# tar xzvf karesansui-xxxx.tar.gz
# cd karesansui
# python setup.py build
# python setup.py install
